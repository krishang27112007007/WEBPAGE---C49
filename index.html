            <h3> TREX RUNNER GAME: </h3>
            <p><br>The Dinosaur Game is a built-in browser game in the Google Chrome web browser. The
                player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a
                higher score.When the Chrome browser is offline, and a user tries to navigate to a web page, the browser
                notifiesthe user that they are not connected to the Internet. An illustration of the "Lonely T-Rex" dinosaur is
                shown at the top, designed by Sebastien Gabriel.Tapping the dinosaur in Android or iOS, or pressing space or ↑ on
                desktop,launches the game. The game can also be accessed by typing chrome://dino or chrome://network-error/-106
                into the URL bar.During gameplay, a running dinosaur moves from left to right across a desert landscape, and the player
                avoids oncoming obstacles by jumping or ducking, including cacti and pterodactyls. Pressing space or ↑ will
                jump,and ↓ will duck (mobile users can only tap the screen to jump). As gameplay progresses, the speed of play
                increases until the user cannot keep up and hits an obstacle, prompting an instant game over.
                When the player reaches 700 points, the game switches from black graphics on white, to white graphics on
                black,representing a shift from day to night. Reaching a score of 900 will switch the color scheme back, and
                will switch back and forth at subsequent milestones. The game was designed to reach a maximum score after
                approximately 17 million years of playtime, in reference to how long the Tyrannosaurus rex existed
                before it went extinct.If an administrator disables the dinosaur game, an error message appears when attempting to play the
                game, featuring a picture of a meteor heading towards the dinosaur. </p>

            <p>Newton's Cradle:<br>The Newton's cradle is a device that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and
                the
                conservation of energy with swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it
                strikes
                the
                stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere
                upward.
                The
                last sphere swings back and strikes the nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite
                direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir Isaac Newton and designed by
                French
                scientist Edme Mariotte. It is also known as Newton's pendulum, Newton's balls, Newton's rocker or
                executive
                ball clicker (since the device makes a click each time the balls collide, which they do repeatedly in a
                steady
                rhythm)</p>

            <p>My Chat Bot:<br>A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation
                (or a
                chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through
                the
                telephone.
                Why are chatbots important? A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising
                expressions
                of interaction between humans and machines. However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only
                represents the natural evolution of a Question Answering system leveraging Natural Language Processing
                (NLP).
                Formulating responses to questions in natural language is one of the most typical Examples of Natural
                Language
                Processing applied in various enterprises’ end-use applications.

                Behind the Scenes: How a Chatbot Works
                There are two different tasks at the core of a chatbot:

                User request analysis
                Returning the response
                How Chatbot Works
                How a Chatbot Works: As you can see in this graphic, a chatbot returns a response based on input from a
                user.
                This process may look simple; in practice, things are quite complex.</p>

            <p>Supply Mission 1:<br>Helicopter Game is a classic game of balance and timing. So, you think you can fly?
                Well,
                don't be so sure! It gets pretty hairy up there, once you're fighting gravity and dealing with an X and
                a Y
                axis
                you might just realize that flying is for the birds. Sharpen your retinas and crack your knuckles. Keep
                an
                eye
                on your speed, watch your altimeter, don't roll, don't overheat, avoid obstacles and try to keep your
                cool
                as
                you turbo thrust your way through a series f levels which get harder, faster, and more impossible to
                pass.
                If
                you thought a game like flappy bird was hard to play, you don't know what you're talking about. You
                literally
                have no idea. This is a chopper game designed to break you, to frustrate and intimidate. Only the
                strongest
                pilots with the most iron of wills and the hardiest hearts will bee able to take on these obstacle
                courses,
                navigate, and survive! How long will you be able to outplay the game itself Can you defeat it to survive
                longer
                than your friends? Will you spend hours of your time racking up a high score only to see all of your
                hard
                work
                dashed in half the time by someone a quarter of your age? Yes absolutely. Such is the curse of
                helicopter
                game.
                Instructions: Use your mouse to steer the chopper. Click the left mouse button to make it rise and try
                to
                tactically time the rate at which it falls in order to successfully navigate each stage.</p>

            <p>My Own Game 1:<br>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and
                sometimes
                used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for
                remuneration,
                and
                from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the
                distinction
                is
                not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator
                sports
                or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong,
                solitaire,
                or
                some video games).

                Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can
                be
                played
                alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of
                non-players,
                such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a
                game
                may
                constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for
                children
                playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not
                the
                same.
                Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.

                Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or
                physical
                stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or
                otherwise
                perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.

                Attested as early as 2600 BC,games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.
                The
                Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.</p>

            <p>Friut Ninja 2: <br> Fruit Ninja is a simple game of slicing fruit. Holding the device sideways, players
                use
                their
                fingers to slice the pieces of fruit that jump into the screen. As the game progresses, more and more
                fruit
                come
                onto the screen, and players can slice multiple fruit at once to score combos. If a piece of fruit falls
                off
                the
                screen without being sliced however, the player earns an “X,” and if this happens three times the game
                is
                over.
                Also, bombs eventually appear on the screen, and if players slice those by accident they will also earn
                a
                game
                over screen. The goal is to rack up as many points as possible, while more and more fruit and bombs
                clutter
                the
                screen. Due to the lack of inappropriate content and simplistic nature of the game, Fruit Ninja is
                recommended
                to players ages 4 and up.</p>
